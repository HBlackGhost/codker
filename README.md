# codker
Codker is a Bash script that checks the HTTP status codes of multiple domains listed in a file. Ideal for web admins and developers, it outputs whether each domain is reachable (200-399) or down (404, 500). Codker also reports the percentage of operational and non-operational domains, making it essential for monitoring web resources
